### API Endpoints

The application follows microservices architecture with distributed endpoints:

#### Main Backend Service (Port: 8080)

##### Authentication
- `POST /auth/register`: Register a new user.
- `POST /auth/login`: Authenticate a user and receive a JWT token.
- `GET /auth/verify`: Verify a user's email address.

##### Contacts
- `POST /contacts`: Add a new contact.
- `GET /contacts`: Get a paginated list of contacts for the current user.
- `GET /contacts/{id}`: Get a specific contact by ID.
- `PUT /contacts/{id}`: Update a contact.
- `DELETE /contacts/{id}`: Delete a contact.
- `GET /contacts/search`: Search for contacts.

##### Admin
- `GET /admin/users`: Get a list of all users.
- `GET /admin/users/{id}`: Get a specific user by ID.
- `DELETE /admin/users/{id}`: Delete a user.

#### Profile Service (Port: 8081)

##### User Profile Management
- `GET /api/profiles/{userId}`: Get user profile by user ID.
- `PUT /api/profiles/{userId}`: Update user profile.
- `POST /api/profiles`: Create new user profile.
- `DELETE /api/profiles/{userId}`: Delete user profile.

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend is a single-page application built with React.

-   **Components:** Reusable UI elements are located in `src/components`. This includes common components like `Navbar` and `Footer`, as well as user-specific components like `UserSidebar` and `ContactModal`.
-   **Pages:** The main views of the application are in `src/pages`. Each page corresponds to a specific route, for example `HomePage`, `LoginPage`, and `DashboardPage`.
-   **Routing:** Client-side routing is handled by `react-router-dom`. The main routes are defined in `App.jsx`. Private routes are used to protect pages that require authentication.
-   **State Management:** Application-wide state, such as user authentication and theme, is managed using React's Context API. The contexts are defined in `src/contexts`.
-   **API Communication:** The frontend communicates with the backend API using `axios`. A pre-configured axios instance in `src/api/axiosConfig.js` is used to automatically include the JWT token in requests.

### Microservices Architecture

The application is built using microservices architecture for better scalability and maintainability:

#### Main Backend Service
- **Purpose:** Core contact management functionality
- **Port:** 8080
- **Database:** MySQL (scm_database)
- **Responsibilities:**
  - User authentication and authorization
  - Contact CRUD operations
  - Admin functionalities
  - Email services

#### Profile Service
- **Purpose:** Dedicated user profile management
- **Port:** 8081
- **Database:** MySQL (profile_database)
- **Responsibilities:**
  - User profile creation and updates
  - Profile data validation
  - Profile-specific business logic
  - Isolated profile data management

#### Benefits of Microservices Approach:
- **Scalability:** Each service can be scaled independently
- **Maintainability:** Easier to maintain and update individual services
- **Technology Diversity:** Each service can use different technologies if needed
- **Fault Isolation:** Issues in one service don't affect others
- **Team Independence:** Different teams can work on different services
